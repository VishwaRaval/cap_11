# Notes:
# - cls=1.8: Heavily penalizes misclassification
# - mixup=0.15: More class mixing to reduce confusion
# - copy_paste=0.2: Augment by pasting minority class instances
# - conf=0.20: Lower threshold to detect more Parrot Fish
# - label_smoothing=0.1: Reduces overconfidence, helps minority class
